# iQbit Standalone Server

So you want to be cool and run this all on its own huh

## Got some Node?

Alright, first thing we'll need is NodeJS.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Run `node -v` to double check. Any version at least somewhat recent should do. Maybe >12 ? idk

## Get it to run

I made it so you can run everything in the root repository once you have node running.

Remember, all these will happen in the ROOT DIRECTORY of this repo.

#### 1. Run `npm run server-setup`

This will copy the `.env.default` into a `.env` file and install all dependencies for this to work.

**Windows Users:** This command uses unix commands to copy the `.env.default` into a `.env` file. If you're on Windows I
suggest manually copying the `.env.default` in the `/server` directory and renaming it to `.env`. Then again in
the `/server` directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

#### 2. Run `npm run server-start`

This will, well, start the server. Additionally it will restart the server (or attempt to) if anything goes wrong.

### 3. Go to `http://localhost:8081` and try to login

If you changed the port in the .env file the port on the url above will be different obviously

### More things to know

### Stopppppp It

You can also run `npm run server-stop` from the root directory to stop the server

### Configuration

I made it so you can change the qBittorrent host server pointer and the port where iQbit will run in the .env file.

Remember,the only file being actually used by the server is `.env`!! `.env.default` is just a setup file.

The env variables look like this

    QBIT_HOST=http://localhost:8080
    STANDALONE_SERVER_PORT=8081

Which makes some assumptions, mainly assuming that you're running this in the same computer you're running qbittorrent.
Which isn't necessary. Since we're proxying requests, you can target a completely different IP for the host.

STANDALONE_SERVER_PORT is the port that the app will use to display iQbit.

### Auto start

You probably have qbittorrent auto starting when your computer boots up right. That's definitely a challenge with this
approach. I suggest looking up how to create a service to run in your OS whenever it boots up to
run `npm run server-start` in the root of this repo. I'm not sure I could solve this within this project :/ Ideas are
welcome

### Docker

For now, you must build the docker image yourself until it is uploaded to a docker registry. To do this, first install docker on windows or mac, then:
`docker build -t iqbit .`

And to run the docker image you created:
`docker container run -dp 8081:8081 -t iqbit`

Navigate to localhost:8081
The proxy can be set as an environment variable, for example:
`docker container run -dp 8081:8081 -e "QBIT_HOST=http://my-domain.com" -t iqbit`

docker-compose example:
Coming soon!
